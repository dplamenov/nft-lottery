# NFT Lottery

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Run test using: `npx hardhat test`
Run test and test coverage using: `npx hardhat coverage`
